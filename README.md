# Hangman_Game_Python

Hangman game is just a word guessing game by guessing the character of the word. In this game, our interpreter generates one random word.

The user asked to guess any alphabet. If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output (with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet. Users will be given 10 turns (can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.
